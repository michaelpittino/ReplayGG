# ReplayGG
ReplayGG is a [replay.gg](replay.gg) replay downloader/manager/launcher.

## How to use
Download the program or compile it yourself, launch it, paste a [replay.gg](http://replay.gg) link in the download-field
and press "Download".  
When the download is finished you can click on your replay and launch it. ReplayGG will start a local http server for
the replay data and will launch League of Legends.  
There you go!

## Configuration
After you launched ReplayGG one time a config file (`config.xml`) is created in the directory.  
Change the `LeagueDir` property to your League of Legends directory (where your League of Legends.exe is).
